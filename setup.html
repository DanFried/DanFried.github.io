        <h2>Setup.</h2>

          <p>
    Using a t-square, center and balance the stencil on your platen. Check your off-contact, I generally like a sixteenth of an inch between the garment and screen. The off-contact adjustment will be different press to press. After adjusting the off-contact be sure the stencil is still centered, you can do this with your micro adjusters if your press has them. Micro adjusters also vary press to press.
          </p>
          <p>
    Make sure you have enough room between the top or bottom of the stencil and the edge of the planten for you to start a good stroke, you don't want the blade falling off at the end of a stroke and leaving a sloppy joe deposit. Adjust all platens to the same position on the press arms. Grab a good clean squeege, tape up your hatch marks/targets and we're off!
